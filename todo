client renders snake in pos 1
server renders snake in pos 2

both snake data will be transferred to each other

both snakes collide with walls and themselves
snakes dont collide with each other

grid based

food position data is continuously passed from server to client

if client eats food send data in buffer TRUE else FALSE

if server eats food generate new food, send new food data to client with a flag maybe

define all structs and other data structures in separate files

need to pass simple structures for snake data and food data continuously

connect through terminal maybe



set up client/server
set up grid(do)
set up snake and controls
generate food
add collision detection
add food detection
increase snake length
terminal inputs(done)
generate new food
longest snake or snake which lives longer wins?
need to write makefile(done)
one executable in the end



TOMORROW
MAKE DOTS APPEAR FOR EACH CLIENT CONNECTION
MAKE DOTS MOVE FOR ALL CLIENTS
MAKE WALLS COLLIDABLE TO CHECK FOR ISSUES IN 5 fps


generate food
eat food
make snake longer
collision
first to 15 wins
